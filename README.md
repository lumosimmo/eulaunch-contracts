# Eulaunch Contracts

Smart contracts for Eulaunch - a token factory and liquidity bootstrapping platform for EulerSwap.

## Versions

There are currently two versions of Eulaunch:

- [Eulaunch V1](./src/v1/README.md) - the original token liquidity bootstrapping platform which launches new tokens and pairs them with an existing quote token.
- [Eulaunch Omni](./src/omni/README.md) - the new version that helps users create new pools with existing tokens and vaults.

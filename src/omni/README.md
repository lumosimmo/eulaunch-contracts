# Eulaunch Omni

Eulaunch Omni helps users create new pools with existing tokens and vaults.

The user becomes the owner of a [`LiquidityManagerOmni`](./LiquidityManagerOmni.sol) contract that acts as the liquidity provider of the EulerSwap pool. They can then close the pool at any time, and the funds will be redeemed to them - or, of course, they can renounce their ownership to make the liquidity permanently locked.

While the pool is live, both underlying tokens will continuously accrue interest, because they are locked in yield-bearing Euler vaults.
